Previously when the plugins are installed, in the application workflows
we used to load these plugins and show them in the dropdown,now for
mysql and oauth along with the existing functionality, dynamic plugin
initialization is added.

**Prerequisite**:

Install the required plugins.

**Test Scenarios:**

1)To add this custom plugin, in database tab, sql insert custom,sql
delete custom,sql update custom,sql select custom nodes are added.

2)For oauth related Oauth custom, oauth token custom , oauth new token
custom nodes are added.

3)Instead of showing plugins in the dropdown, a text box is provided
where the required installed plugin name is provided.

4)That particular plugin details are fetched and executed accordingly.
