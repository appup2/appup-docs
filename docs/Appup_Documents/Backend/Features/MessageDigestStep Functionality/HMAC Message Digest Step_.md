***HMAC Message Digest Step:***

(**HMAC-Hash-based message authentication code**) is a mechanism for
calculating a message authentication code involving a hash function in
combination with a secret key. This can be used to verify the integrity
and authenticity of a a message.

A message authentication code (MAC) is produced from a message and a
secret key by a MAC algorithm

***Workflow:***

In the workflow required message has to be provided along with the
secret key. These both are considered as inputs. There are different
hash mac algorithms which are used to authenticate it.

Please check the below screenshots how to configure it.

***Hash Function Message Digest Step:***

Hash function digest step usually considers the message and uses hash
algorithm to produce the authentication code.

The main difference between hash function message digest and hmac
message digest is in Hmac it uses a secret key which we provide in order
to produce a authentication code. But in hash function message step it
uses only algorithm to authenticate.
