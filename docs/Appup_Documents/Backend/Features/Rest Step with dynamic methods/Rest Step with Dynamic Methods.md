**Functionality**

Previously when rest step is used along with the raw data, there is an
issue where it was not accepting raw data. Rest node with dynamic
methods is not taking raw body data. Now support is provided to the node
to accept the raw data also getting the response when raw data is
provided.

**Note**: Please add ‘Accept’ key in headers with required value.
