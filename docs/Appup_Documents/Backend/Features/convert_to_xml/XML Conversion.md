**XML Conversion:**

In workflow nodes we have a node ‘Convert Data’ which is actually used
to convert data from one format to another format.There are few formats
which are being supported like json ,json objects,xml,yaml conversions
etc.

As of now we already have support to convert data to xml format. To this
one more field is added which is the ‘Root Element Name’. So when we are
trying to convert data to xml format a parent element can be added if
required.
