**Training - Marketplace App**

**Functionality:**

In a training app, each and every workflow has its own functionality.

When we try to retrieve data from a particular table based on some
conditions we configured two workflows.

And when we try to retrieve to get the weather information about a
particular city or the wind speed of that city we provided two
workflows.

And for the rest API call if we pass any message to get the request
headers we configure one more workflow.

**Technical Details:**

Workflow 1(Print Request Headers): This workflow should verify the
request header values based on the URL we provided.

Workflow 2(Increment Count): This workflow should increment value for
integer, float value.

Workflow 3(DB GET Entities): This workflow should take DB name
dynamically and check the DB entities.

Workflow 4(GET Weather Info): This workflow should get weather info
based on the city name.

Workflow 5(DB Generics Select): This workflow should retrieve the values
from the DB with generic queries.

Workflow 6(REST\_NODE\_JSON\_EXTRACT): This Workflow should get wind
speed and city information based on the city name.
